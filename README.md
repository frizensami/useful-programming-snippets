#Useful Programming Snippets

The code inside is mostly not mine, these are just useful snippets gathered from the web and other sources over time

Currently there is a problem with the NamedPipes snippets where while messages can be sent, for some reason the when comparing the recieved message to expected strings, there is a problem
Sending string versions of integers and converting them to ints during processing is currently the best current solution
